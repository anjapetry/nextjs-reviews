        <p>Hi, I'm Anja, your trusted hobbyist reviewer here on Indie Music Reviews. Besides being a life-long music lover, an avid reader and an aspiring writer, I'm also a big fan of (play)lists, so you'll find plenty of those here. You'll also find a lot of indie music, of course, but I'll also be reviewing some jazz and jazz-adjacent material from time to time. I hope you enjoy my reviews and lists, and feel free to send me your suggestions for new darlings to <a href="/contact">contact us</a>!
        </p>
